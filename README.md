**Admin**: Refers to an authorized administrator with access to system management features.

## 2. Project Overview
### 2.1. Problem Statement
Semako Thrifting Union requires a system to manage its members' monthly savings and transactions. The system must allow members to create and manage accounts, view account details, enroll in schemes, make payments, and provide admins with tools for user management and monitoring.

### 2.2. System Goals
The system aims to achieve the following goals:
- Enable members to manage their thrift savings efficiently.
- Provide a user-friendly platform for enrolling in savings schemes.
- Ensure transparent communication regarding fee deductions.
- Offer admins control over schemes, rates, and user management.

### 2.3. Key Features
The key features of the system include:
- Member registration and login.
- Member account management and dashboard.
- Savings scheme enrollment and management.
- Payment processing with multiple methods.
- Admin panel for user management and system monitoring.

### 2.4. User Roles
The system defines two primary user roles:
- **Members**: End-users who create accounts, make savings, and enroll in schemes.
- **Admins**: System administrators with privileges to manage users and schemes.

## 3. Architecture
### 3.1. Front-End
The front-end is developed using React, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface for members and admins.

### 3.2. State Management
State management is implemented using Redux to handle complex application states, including member data, schemes, and transactions.

### 3.3. User Authentication
Secure user authentication mechanisms are implemented to protect member accounts. This includes registration, login, and password management.

### 3.4. Admin Panel
An admin panel allows authorized users to manage member accounts, view transaction history, and monitor system performance.

### 3.5. Payment Handling
Members can make payments using various methods, including credit/debit cards and bank transfers.

### 3.6. Notification System
A notification system informs members about important updates such as successful payments, scheme maturities, and fee deductions.

## 4. Component Structure
The front-end components are organized into two categories:
### 4.1. Earnings Components
Components related to earnings and schemes, including scheme enrollment, interest rates, and maturity details.

### 4.2. Deductions Components
Components dealing with deductions, such as payment processing, fee calculation, and admin functionalities.

## 5. User Flows
The system supports various user flows:
### 5.1. Member Registration
- Members provide personal information for account creation.
- A 15-character PIN is generated for each member.

### 5.2. Member Login
- Members log in with their credentials.
- The dashboard displays their account details.

### 5.3. Member Dashboard
- Members view their current balance, account history, and active schemes.
- They can enroll in new schemes and make payments.

### 5.4. Scheme Enrollment
- Members view available schemes, including interest rates and maturity details.
- They can enroll in schemes, and these details are stored in their account.

### 5.5. Payment Processing
- Members make payments using different methods.
- Admin and maintenance fees are deducted as per the system's rules.

### 5.6. Admin Functions
- Admins manage member accounts, view transaction history, and oversee scheme operations.
